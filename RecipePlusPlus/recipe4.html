        * Mix yeast with sugar and one teaspoon warm water and set aside until frothy.

        * Add salt, olive oil and wheat bran.

        * Add water and knead into a soft dough. Leave the dough covered with a damp cloth in a warm place
          for about forty five minutes or until dough is about double in volume.

        * Divide pizza dough into four, roll out each portion into medium thick eight-inch
          discs. Prick with a fork all over. Preheat oven to 220°C.

        * For sauce, heat olive oil in a pan, add chopped onion and garlic, stir-fry
          briefly and add chopped tomatoes.

        * Add one cup of water and bring it to a boil.

        * Stir in basil leaves, salt and crushed dried red chillies.

        * Spread prepared pizza sauce on rolled pizza base, top it with sliced onion,
          sliced mushrooms, tomato and green capsicum strips.

        * Finally sprinkle grated low-fat mozzarella cheese to evenly cover the pizza top.
          Brush with olive oil.

        * Place it on greased ovenproof tray and bake in the preheated oven at 220°C for
          about twenty minutes or until the pizza base is crisp and the cheese melts and
          starts bubbling.

          serve hot.
